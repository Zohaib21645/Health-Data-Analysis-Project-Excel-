# 📊 Health Data Analysis Project (Excel)

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze patient data from multiple hospitals and extract key healthcare insights.  
- Explore disease patterns, treatment costs, demographic distributions, and insurance coverage.  
- Build dashboards that help visualize hospital performance and patient statistics.  

## ❓ Key Questions / KPIs
1. Which hospitals have the highest number of patients?  
2. What are the most common diseases treated?  
3. What is the age and gender distribution of patients?  
4. What is the average treatment cost per disease and per hospital?  
5. How many patients are covered by insurance vs. self-paying?  
6. Which cities/provinces show the highest patient concentration?  

## ⚙️ Process
- Imported raw healthcare dataset into Excel.  
- Cleaned and formatted data (dates, missing values, duplicates).  
- Created Pivot Tables for disease frequency, hospital performance, and cost analysis.  
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs (patients by hospital, cost by disease, demographics).  

## 🔎 Insights
- Some hospitals treat significantly more patients, showing higher healthcare demand in those regions.  
- Cancer, Diabetes, and COVID-19 appear as the most costly and frequent diseases.  
- Male and female patients are nearly balanced, but some diseases show gender/age patterns.  
- Insurance coverage reduces cost burden but remains uneven across hospitals.  
- Certain provinces contribute the majority of patient inflow, indicating regional healthcare dependency.  

## ✅ Conclusion
This project highlights how Excel can be used to extract meaningful insights from healthcare data.  
By analyzing hospitals, diseases, demographics, and costs, healthcare providers and policymakers can make more data-driven decisions.
